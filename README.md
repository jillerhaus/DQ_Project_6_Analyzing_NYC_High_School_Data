# DataQuest Project 3: Visualizing Earnings Based on Majors

This is the sixth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project multiple datasets from New York City schools were combined and analyzed. The datasets were formatted very differently to one another and combining and cleaning the data was the main challenge in this project. After this an analysis was conducted on possible effects on the SAT scores of different schools.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the jupyter notebook as well as the files contained in the `schools` folder to run. In the `schools` folder the datasets used for the analysis are contained. They are in both six `CSV` files and two `TXT` files.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `basemap` and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console. It is important to note that `basemap` has to be installed and run within a virutal environment in order to work properly. An example of how a virtual environment can be created can be seen [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/).
